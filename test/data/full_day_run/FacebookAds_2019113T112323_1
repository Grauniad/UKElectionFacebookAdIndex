In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek she admitted that, \u201cHe knew there was a potential for conflict, and this is why he never did anything.\u201d Yet despite this Arcuri rejects any accusation that she was afforded any favoritism.\n\nhttps:\/\/bywire.news\/articles\/prime-minister-boris-johnson-knew-of-conflict-with-arcuri-firm","ad_creation_time":"2019-11-02T14:44:02+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"1000","upper_bound":"1999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.183138","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.010366","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.000691","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.004838","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.003455","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.02557","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.004147","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.01244","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.041465","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.174845","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.015204","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.021424","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.024188","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.093988","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.083621","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.162405","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.137526","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.000691","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Colne Valley Conservatives","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"1","region":"England"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-11-02T14:31:01+0000","ad_delivery_stop_time":"2019-11-04T14:19:46+0000","ad_creative_link_description":"Pledge to Back Boris and avoid further delay.","ad_creative_link_title":"\ud83d\uddf3 Your vote in Colne Valley can Get Brexit Done.","ad_creative_link_caption":"CONSERVATIVES.COM","ad_creative_body":"Your vote in Colne Valley will be the difference between a majority government that will Get Brexit Done and another hung Parliament.\n\nIt only takes 458 people to switch their vote in Colne Valley to elect a Conservative MP that will Back Boris to Get Brexit Done.\n\nA vote for anyone else, including the Brexit Party, will just create a hung Parliament with more delay, confusion, and indecision.","ad_creation_time":"2019-11-02T14:31:01+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.156658","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.057441","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.174935","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.086162","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.101828","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.083551","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.028721","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.133159","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.057441","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.002611","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.031332","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.02611","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.052219","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.007833","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Best For Britain","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.994404","region":"England"},{"percentage":"0.005596","region":"Wales"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-11-02T14:26:36+0000","ad_creative_link_description":"Get on the electoral register so you can vote in elections and referendums.","ad_creative_link_title":"Register to vote","ad_creative_link_caption":"gov.uk","ad_creative_body":"Faster than brewing a cuppa.

the Tories at this election, addressing the issue in our own constituency East Worthing & Shoreham.   It contains my personal message to members and supporters of Worthing & Adur Liberal Democrats and Adur Green Party. \n\nUnless you honestly prefer the policies of Johnson's Conservatives to those of the Labour Party and aren't worried about Loughton getting in with a minority of votes cast, please don't campaign here. Give us a clear run. \n\nAt the 2017 general election Labour shaved 11,000 off the Tory vote in what as you know has been a Tory seat since the Stone Age. We are now just 5,000 votes away from making incredible history and giving our area its first ever Labour MP in the shape of the fiery and ace Lavinia O'Connor. \n\nLib Dems, you have a seat to regain in Lewes and a marginal one to hold on to in Eastbourne. Greens, you have Caroline a few miles away. Don't waste your energy round here.  I know that Lewes Labour Party are concentrating on marginal seats elsewhere, including ours, and I have had promises from Labour activists in Caroline's Brighton Pavilion constituency to help us here too. \n\nPlease return the favour. I don't give a gnat's testicle about party lines. I just want the Tories out. If you share my view, you know what to do :)","ad_creation_time":"2019-11-01T14:19:17+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.046595","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.136201","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.297491","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.24552","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.078853","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.064516","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.069892","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.001792","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.02509","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.003584","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.012545","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.003584","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.001792","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.007168","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.003584","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.001792","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Rishi Sunak","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.999858","region":"England"},{"percentage":"0.000142","region":"Unknown"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-11-01T14:10:56+0000","ad_delivery_stop_time":"2019-11-05T14:10:36+0000","ad_creative_link_caption":"www.rishisunak.com","ad_creative_body":"HELP ME TO HELP YOU\nTell me about the issues which most matter to you.

BOOST TO LOCAL ECONOMY AS SURREY COUNTY COUNCIL MOVES TO WOKING\n \nSurrey County Council is moving out of County Hall in Kingston and is moving to Midas House, Goldsworth Road, Woking. The Council is moving its headquarters back into the heart of the county, after more than 50 years located outside Surrey\u2019s boundaries.\n \nWoking Borough Council Leader Cllr David Bittleston stated \u201cI am thrilled to welcome Surrey County Council back to the centre of the county. It is fantastic news both for Woking and the wider county. The move will be a major boost for Woking, bringing further new and exciting economic opportunities, jobs and making the town busier and more vibrant. Surrey County Council's decision to relocate shows that Woking's regeneration and town improvement works are attracting key businesses and employers to the borough.\u201d\n \n2. WOKING CONFIRMED AS HAPPIEST PLACE TO LIVE IN SURREY\n \nWoking reached peak happiness in the government\u2019s official national well-being index, as recorded by the Office of National Statistics, scoring an average happiness level of 8.1 out of 10. The UK-wide average was 7.6. Woking\u2019s happiness ranking has been climbing steadily since the index was first launched eight years ago, reaching a record this year and outstripping the majority of towns and cities nationwide.\n \nThese two stories are a testament to the hard work and dedication of the town\u2019s residents and our hard working Councillors who constantly promote Woking, its services and its people. We\u2019re very proud to be both the happiest place in Surrey and the new home of Surrey County Council which will bring jobs, growth and spend to the town, as well as saving tax payers money.","ad_creation_time":"2019-11-01T13:18:47+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"4000","upper_bound":"4999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.088435","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.053061","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.001905","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.002993","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.023401","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.002721","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.002993","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.046803","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.120816","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.094422","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.104762","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.063129","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.082177","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.004082","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.089252","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.122993","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.095238","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.000816","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"CARVE Surfing Magazine","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.81018","region":"England"},{"percentage":"0.066467","region":"Wales"},{"percentage":"0.088024","region":"Scotland"},{"percentage":"0.035329","region":"Northern Ireland"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-11-01T13:08:10+0000","ad_delivery_stop_time":"2019-11-06T13:07:56+0000","ad_creative_link_title":"Little Turtle Turns the Tide","ad_creative_body":"Little Turtle Turns the Tide - an inspirational children\u2019s book with a powerful message.

Labour was forecast to go down to its worst electoral defeat since Ramsay MacDonald occupied the leadership of the party. During the election, Labour fought a fairly united and disciplined campaign. Not quite winning, but securing the biggest election gains since Blair in 2001, and depriving the Tories of a majority was a success.\n\nBoris Johnson\u2019s premiership, indeed his entire career, has been defined by one thing: the eventual emergence of truth. Johnson is probably the most duplicitous Prime Minister in modern times. He was selected as Conservative leader because the Conservative Party believes he can win, just as he did in London. Many voted for him holding their nose. Labour can prove them wrong and Jeremy can beat Johnson and knock the Tories out of power.\n\nhttps:\/\/bywire.news\/articles\/do-not-believe-the-hype-of-course-jeremy-corbyn-can-and-will-beat-boris-johnson-at-the-next-election","ad_creation_time":"2019-11-01T12:51:25+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"3000","upper_bound":"3999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.19238","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.101385","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.000315","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.000945","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.004408","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.005668","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.010076","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.034635","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.019207","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.167821","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.028967","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.003463","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.044081","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.093514","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.034635","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.113665","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.144521","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.000315","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Watford Liberal Democrats ","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"1","region":"England"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-11-01T12:49:56+0000","ad_delivery_stop_time":"2019-11-06T12:49:41+0000","ad_creative_body":"Everything has changed since 2017.\n\nWith the Liberal Democrats topping the poll here at this year\u2019s European elections and getting record breaking local election results, Labour are on the decline and we can win in Watford.\n\nThe latest odds shows that the election race will be between Ian Stotesbury and the Brexit backing Conservative candidate.","ad_creation_time":"2019-11-01T12:49:56+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"2000","upper_bound":"2999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.178848","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.137874","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.08804","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.237542","age":"13-17","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.207641","age":"13-17","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.007198","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.048726","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.06423","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.020487","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.001661","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.001107","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.003322","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.002215","age":"13-17","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.000554","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.000554","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Claire Rosalyn Gill","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"1","region":"England"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-11-01T12:40:43+0000","ad_delivery_stop_time":"2019-11-06T12:40:43+0000","ad_creative_body":"It was great to meet with the Secretary of State for Health Matt Hancock yesterday to discuss The Royal Blackburn Hospital and how it will be one of many hospitals to receive new MRI and CT scanners.

That is why I have voted consistently to leave the EU, with or without a deal, and it is incredibly frustrating that this Parliament has, time and time again, prevented us from leaving.\n\nThis General Election gives us the opportunity to elect a new Parliament that respects the referendum result, and I will be standing again as the Conservative candidate.\n\nTo my mind, this has all gone on too long and we must now move on and get Brexit done. This will allow us to focus again on delivering an exciting domestic agenda that will deliver: more police officers, more funding for our schools and hospitals, and truly world-class infrastructure. And, of course, a domestic agenda that no longer overlooks places like the Clacton constituency, as has so often been the case in the past.\n\nSo, turn out on 12th December 2019 and vote Conservative! Help me and Boris deliver Brexit, so we can move on to consider other equally important issues.\n\nIf you would like to stay up to date with my activities during the election period, you can sign up

if his extradition to the US happens as planned he will face numerous potential human rights violations and that he has the right to expect asylum and refuge within the UK, given that he faces hundreds of years in prison should he be convicted on American soil, a potential sentence highly disproportionate to his alleged offences.\n\nSince its inception in 2006, non-profit organisation WikiLeaks has exposed many wrongdoings, illegal activities and human rights violations by making countless classified military and government documents, emails, videos and diplomatic cables available to the public. \n\nThese have included an expose on US detention camp Guantanamo Bay, where some prisoners were designated as off-limits to the international community of the Red Cross (something the US military had previously denied) and the release of the infamous and horrifying classified US military footage from an attack on Baghdad during the Iraq war. \n\nThis material exposed alleged war crimes that included US military forces laughing as they fired from a gunship at two Reuters journalists, civilians, children and Iraqi emergency services, killing many.  \n\nIn 2010, a 22-year-old US Army Intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning (formerly known as Bradley) was arrested and charged with leaking classified information garnered from government systems (including the Baghdad airstrike video along with around 260,000 classified US embassy cables \u2013 all of which were subsequently published by WikiLeaks.)\n\nAssange and his organisation refused to confirm Manning as the

stop climate breakdown and properly respond to the ecological emergency, we need politicians from all parties to work together to make it happen. That's why in September Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and I published the bill for a Green New Deal for the UK setting out a transformative programme driven by the principles of justice and equity. \n\nOur country needs investment and a worker-led just transition. Too many areas have been all but abandoned by Westminster over the past 30 years: industries shut down with nothing to replace the jobs lost; people ignored and disempowered.\n\nSo how will our bill help this? First, we need to fundamentally change the way our economy is managed, so that democratically elected governments \u2013 not the whims of the market \u2013 set our future direction. \n\nIt means moving away from the pursuit of growth as the primary economic objective. Instead, we should prioritise health and wellbeing, reducing inequality and \u2013 crucially \u2013 tackling the climate emergency. \n\nAn overwhelming majority of the public think the climate emergency is the most important issue we face. Politicians need to respond: there is no time to waste and a nation to transform. \n\nThis Bill was the first of its kind to be introduced in Parliament to try and genuinely legislate for a fair and just transition while we tackle the climate emergency. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/uk\/politics\/green-new-deal-labour-climate-change-net-zero-clive-lewis-caroline-lucas-a9111796.html","ad_creation_time":"2019-10-31T15:23:45+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"100","upper_bound":"199"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"15000","upper_bound":"19999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.061639","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.024749","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.001868","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.000467","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.002568","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.004903","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.017978","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.003969","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.033855","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.118608","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.081718","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.051366","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.08989","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.120009","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.066542","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.202662","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.115807","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.001401","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Stephen Donald Hunt","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"1","region":"England"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-10-31T22:48:49+0000","ad_delivery_stop_time":"2019-11-05T22:48:47+0000","ad_creative_link_title":"All 'Smoke and Broken Mirrors' at EHDC's Liphook Hotel","ad_creative_body":"EHDC Liphook services Hotel Investment update...","ad_creation_time":"2019-10-31T22:48:47+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"1000","upper_bound":"1999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.134571","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.058778","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.001547","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.00464","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.009281","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.005414","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.009281","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.034803","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.08894","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.042537","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.063418","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.135344","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.017788","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.139211","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.082753","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.037896","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.133024","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.000773","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Bruce Roy Wilson","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"1","region":"Scotland"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-10-31T22:40:13+0000","ad_delivery_stop_time":"2019-11-05T22:40:10+0000","ad_creative_body":"If you believe in Scotland as part of the UK and the UK as part of the EU, then there is only one party to choose!
