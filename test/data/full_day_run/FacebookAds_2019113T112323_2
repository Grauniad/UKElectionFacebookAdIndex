While that is encouraging, I\u2019m still clear it was a mistake to drop this vital project down the agenda. That decision needs to be reversed.\n\nI\u2019m pushing ahead with delivering Soham Station, with construction work starting in September 2020. We're moving forward with enhancing our Fenland rail stations at Manea, March and Whittlesey with better facilities and pushing for far more regular services between Peterborough and Cambridge. We are developing Wisbech Rail, bringing the town back onto the mainline with a new station and rail link. And we are working on delivery of a station at Cambridge South no later than 2023 \u2013 years ahead of East West Rail.\n\nBut all of these upgrades will be massively enhanced by sorting out the rail infrastructure around Ely North Junction. \n\nIt is currently nowhere near what a modern, 21st Century economy should expect, and it is holding back our growth.

I and other Members of Parliament have voted for a General Election to take place on the 12th December. \n\nIt is a privilege and honour to serve as your Member of Parliament. I have done everything in my power to meet the challenges we have faced and bring about successes as an opposition MP but now there is a chance to fundamentally change Bedford and Kempston, and the UK for the better.\n\nTogether we have protected vital services at Bedford Hospital and Putnoe Walk-in Centre. At the last election I pledged to save these services and with your support, we did just that. Local services, which local people value and cherish most, will always be my priority.\n\nThese are services we have seen decimated under a Conservative government which is long past its time. Brexit may have dominated headlines but cuts to healthcare, education and policing are blighting lives here in Bedford and Kempston.\n\nWe need our public services back and they must be properly funded. Only the Labour Party will ensure Bedfordshire Police have the resources they need to keep your family safe. The Tories took 20,000 police off the street and levels of crime are rising. Labour will bring community policing back to our streets. Labour will also fund youth and rehabilitation services to tackle the causes of crime. \n\nAs a commuter, I understand the impact railway chaos is having on peoples work and family lives. I have spoken out, lobbied and represented rail users at the highest level and will continue to speak out against cuts to rail services. Labour will bring our railways back into public ownership, so they are run in the interests of passengers, not private profit.  The Tories do not want to listen, but I will not stop fighting for passengers.\n\nThis election is a clear choice between the local Labour MP for Bedford and Kempston and the Conservatives. Bedford has been my home for 27 years. I have raised my family here and depend on local NHS services, schools and council services like my constituents. The Tories have a candidate from Hertfordshire who supports Boris Johnson\u2019s disastrous Brexit plans. I believe Bedford and Kempston residents should have their say over any deal. \n\nRegardless of the election, Bedford will continue to be the place I call home and I will continue to stand up for our towns.","ad_creation_time":"2019-10-30T08:03:10+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"5000","upper_bound":"5999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.00036","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.097482","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.002518","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.002158","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.004317","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.078417","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.040647","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.103597","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.081295","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.105755","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.010791","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.12554","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.028417","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.080935","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.001079","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.093165","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.140288","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.003237","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"USR Diaspora","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.926208","region":"England"},{"percentage":"0.020654","region":"Wales"},{"percentage":"0.032202","region":"Scotland"},{"percentage":"0.020936","region":"Northern Ireland"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-10-30T08:00:36+0000","ad_delivery_stop_time":"2019-11-07T11:39:31+0000","ad_creative_link_description":"Despre proiecte de \u021bar\u0103 \u0219i despre cum viziunea noastr\u0103 poate inspira o schimbare profund\u0103 la toate nivelurile Rom\u00e2niei.

misleading to claim the Lib Dems refused to support an end to NHS privatisation","ad_creative_link_caption":"fullfact.org","ad_creative_body":"When it comes to our NHS, clarity and honesty are vital. \n\nHere is what happened this week in Parliament with an NHS vote, according to FullFact.org:\n\n\"[On Oct 23rd], parliament voted against a motion brought forward by the Labour party to express regret that the Queen\u2019s Speech didn\u2019t include a pledge to repeal the 2012 Health and Social Care Act.\n\nAll Liberal Democrat MPs abstained from the vote, and a viral tweet subsequently claimed that \u201c19 Liberal Democrat MPs refused to support a motion to stop privatisation of the NHS\u201d.\n\nThe motion would not have stopped the \u201cprivatisation of the NHS\u201d. To describe the motion and the Liberal Democrats decision not to support it as such is misleading and excludes important context.\n\nThe tweet was deleted after publication of this article.\"\n \nAt a time when our health service is under massive threat from Brexit, it is so important that political parties act with great care.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are supporting the proposals the NHS recommended to Parliament. We will support the legislative changes the NHS needs, following the extensive consultation between the NHS and the cross-party Health and Social Care Select Committee lead by Liberal Democrat MP Sarah Wollaston.\n\nThese proposals have widespread support from the NHS workforce and those working alongside them.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are listening to what the NHS and the public want. Instead of focusing on these problems, Labour is proposing to repeal a piece of legislation, without saying what they will replace it with. They cannot turn the clock, all they would achieve is creating a vacuum in the NHS.\n\nLiberal Democrats have also led in Parliament in defending the NHS from the prospect of it being opened up and sold off in international trade deals to countries such as the USA. \n\nThis has only become a threat thanks to Brexit, which Labour have supported. If Labour really care about the NHS they must stop pursuing Brexit and instead support the Liberal Democrat demand to Stop Brexit.","ad_creation_time":"2019-10-25T15:28:55+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"5000","upper_bound":"5999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.002019","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.077513","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.002422","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.003633","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.006056","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.058539","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.041583","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.005652","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.080743","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.089625","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.03916","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.106581","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.104562","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.091239","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.115462","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.104562","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.06742","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.00323","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Ealing Liberal Democrats","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"1","region":"England"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-10-25T15:14:30+0000","ad_creative_link_description":"Click \"Learn More\"","ad_creative_link_title":"Meet Sonul Badiani","ad_creative_link_caption":"ealinglibdems.org.uk","ad_creative_body":"Meet Sonul Badiani your Liberal Democrats candidate for Ealing Central and Acton in the upcoming General Election.","ad_creation_time":"2019-10-25T15:14:30+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"0","upper_bound":"99"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"7000","upper_bound":"7999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.006552","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.042087","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.03377","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.054435","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.071825","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.113659","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.046623","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.055696","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.06502","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.029234","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.200353","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.201613","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.00504","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.00126","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.004788","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.007308","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.001764","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.058972","age":"65+","gender":"male"}]},{"funding_entity":"Ealing Liberal Democrats","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"1","region":"England"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-10-25T15:14:30+0000","ad_creative_link_description":"Click on 'Learn More' for more information about Sonul.","ad_creative_link_title":"Vote for Sonul, Vote Lib Dems and Stop Brexit.","ad_creative_link_caption":"ealinglibdems.org.uk","ad_creative_body":"The Lib Dems can win in Ealing, Central and Acton where 72\u0025 of us voted to remain in the EU.

Guess what, it\u2019s not through property investing\u2026  ","ad_creative_body":"As I\u2019m sure you are only too aware, the Government seems determined to drive small buy-to-let landlords out of business. A raft of new legislation is making this a difficult game to win, and that\u2019s before you even begin to worry about any new legislation a Labour government may introduce\u2026 \n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say: The good times for property investors are over. \n\nIn the last few years, the government has introduced a bunch of new regulations that have made it increasingly difficult to operate as a small landlord. Some of this is no doubt intentioned to make life better and safer for tenants \u2014 which is good \u2014 but much of it is undoubtedly designed to make life far more complicated and expensive for landlords. The message is clear \u2014 the government does not want you taking care of your own financial future through buy-to-let. \n\nFrom the additional 3\u0025 stamp duty, to the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief, to the new HMO licensing rules, to the higher Capital Gains Tax aimed directly at second homeowners, to the plans to scrap section 21 evictions, life is getting a whole lot harder for landlords. \n\nIndeed, if you believe the surveys, droves of small-time landlords are just giving up the ghost and walking away. I can\u2019t blame them.  \n\nBut why am I telling you this?  \n\nBecause there is a better way to deploy your hard-earned nest egg. \n\nOver the last couple of decades, I have researched, implemented, regretted, improved, and written about pretty much every source of investment going.  \n\nAnd whilst I would always advocate diversifying your savings amongst different asset classes, one strategy has leapt to the front to become my weapon of choice\u2026 \n\nFIRE Revolution \n\nI call it the FIRE Revolution strategy.  \n\nI\u2019ve spent the last year building a programme to teach regular folks like you, how to generate repeatable income from some of the biggest and safest companies in the world. \n\nAlthough I\u2019ve based much of it on my own years of real-world experience, the techniques covered in the programme, are well known and understood in the elite investment world. But, as with many of these things, the experts like to keep them to themselves. \n\nYour financial advisor will not tell you about this as there is no profit in it for him. And your bank manager is probably too busy trying to sell you their latest convoluted structured product. \n\nHowever, many financial institutions regularly use these concepts, and a certain Warren Buffett is known to love this strategy for acquiring new positions in the companies he buys. \n\nIndeed, as Mr. Buffett once said: \n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die\u201d \n\nI couldn\u2019t agree more, and that\u2019s why I have written a 16-page report highlighting your path to financial independence, and it doesn\u2019t involve a single buy-to-let. \n\nPress the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy of FIRE Revolution: The blueprint to your financial freedom.","ad_creation_time":"2019-10-21T10:48:19+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"100","upper_bound":"199"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"10000","upper_bound":"14999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.225671","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.165855","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.060156","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.162456","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.009176","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.239266","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.037159","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.029908","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.010876","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.022884","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.014161","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.006684","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.010649","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.001699","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.003399","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Joanna Mary Bega","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.833097","region":"England"},{"percentage":"0.043324","region":"Wales"},{"percentage":"0.090909","region":"Scotland"},{"percentage":"0.03267","region":"Northern Ireland"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-10-21T10:00:57+0000","ad_delivery_stop_time":"2019-11-04T11:00:57+0000","ad_creative_link_description":"SIGN OUR PETITION","ad_creative_link_title":"Give children back their childhood","ad_creative_link_caption":"actionnetwork.org","ad_creative_body":"Deepak was 9 when he was trafficked to work in a metalwork factory.

know the secret to successful investing? ","ad_creative_body":"It\u2019s no secret that the FTSE 100 is currently cheap and that it is jam-packed with world-class dividend-yielding blue-chip stocks. \n \nThe ongoing slow-motion car crash known as Brexit has suppressed the FTSE 100 and it\u2019s currently trading at a level that makes it one of the cheapest developed markets in the world. And, that in turn, means that it now sports some of the highest dividend yields in the world.  \n\nAs dividend-focused investors, we are living in a golden age of sky-high dividends being paid by some of the biggest and best quality companies in the world.  \n\nIt is quite possible to build a diversified portfolio of blue-chip stocks with a dividend yield north of 5\u0025, or even 6\u0025, and that\u2019s a great basis for any investor\u2019s portfolio. But what if I told you there was a strategy you can employ that would boost that yield way up into double figures.  \n\nIndeed, it does not rely on just one income stream. But four!  \n\nWelcome to the revolution. The FIRE Revolution.  \n \nTHE FIRE REVOLUTION INCOME STRATEGY \n\nThe FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by investing in some of the biggest and most boring companies in the world. Companies you will have come across in your everyday life such as GlaxoSmithKline, National Grid, BP, Aviva, ITV, Pfizer, Caterpillar, BP, and many more. The sort of companies that many income investors probably already own.  \n \nThe FIRE Revolution strategy makes money by relying on two things that are far more predictable than forecasting the future direction of a share \u2014 dividends, and the inevitable time decay of stock options.  \n \nNow, if you have just seen the word \u201coptions\u201d and tuned out, please don\u2019t. They are as easy to trade as stocks.  You just need the helping hand of an expert to explain how.  \n\nAnd \u2014 if used as I teach you \u2014 they are perfectly safe.   \n \nIn fact, selling options on boring blue-chip stocks is actually less risky than buying the stocks outright. Of course, like all investments, there is still a risk. But this strategy is firmly at the lower-risk end of the spectrum.  \n \nI teach income starved investors how to sell covered calls and cash-secured puts using the FIRE Revolution strategy. The techniques are well known to bankers, hedge funds and savvy private investors. But the specific implementation is all mine.  \n\nOver a thirteen-week group coaching programme, we will work together to teach you the exact real-world skills you need to go from novice investor to expert stock option seller. Not just the free content you can pick up on the web, but the essential specifics I\u2019ve learned after slogging away at the coal face for many years.   \n\nI\u2019ve prepared a 16-page report that explains the whole strategy, just press the LEARN MORE button to download your free copy.","ad_creation_time":"2019-10-15T12:35:45+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"100","upper_bound":"199"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"10000","upper_bound":"14999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.002735","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.009435","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.005333","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.003829","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.006153","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.009572","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.002598","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.01217","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.007247","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.190483","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.007521","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.012033","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.075482","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.113633","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.147409","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.18009","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.213729","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.000547","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Michael John Galsworthy","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.000291","region":"Unknown"},{"percentage":"0.999709","region":"England"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-10-15T10:48:09+0000","ad_creative_link_description":"Community","ad_creative_link_title":"Southport for Europe - Public Page","ad_creative_link_caption":"www.facebook.com","ad_creative_body":"We are Southport residents fighting against Brexit.\n\nLIKE our page to support!","ad_creation_time":"2019-10-15T10:47:39+0000","spend":{"lower_bound":"200","upper_bound":"299"},"impressions":{"lower_bound":"30000","upper_bound":"34999"},"demographic_distribution":[{"percentage":"9.4E-5","age":"13-17","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.001034","age":"18-24","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.002633","age":"65+","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.002821","age":"55-64","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.005547","age":"13-17","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.044096","age":"18-24","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.003761","age":"13-17","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.00141","age":"25-34","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.101072","age":"45-54","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.07578","age":"55-64","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.086405","age":"45-54","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.127492","age":"25-34","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.094678","age":"25-34","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.122791","age":"35-44","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.080669","age":"35-44","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.051429","age":"65+","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.062712","age":"55-64","gender":"male"},{"percentage":"0.002162","age":"35-44","gender":"unknown"},{"percentage":"0.073524","age":"18-24","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.057258","age":"65+","gender":"female"},{"percentage":"0.002633","age":"45-54","gender":"unknown"}]},{"funding_entity":"Michael John Galsworthy","region_distribution":[{"percentage":"0.000205","region":"Unknown"},{"percentage":"0.999795","region":"England"}],"ad_delivery_start_time":"2019-10-15T08:17:56+0000","ad_creative_link_description":"RV4EU is a non partisan group for constituents to discuss the effects of Brexit and what we can do about it. \nAll political affiliations welcome as long as you are prepared to work together in the interest of the Ribble Valley and our country.
