This is a straight up hackjob to get something going.

The correct solution to this is *obviously* to be push up containers rather,
than hacking zips like this.

Once we've got the core functionality up and running, we can come back to this.
For now, this gives us a repeatable build given we (I) are building and
uploading from a single dev env.
